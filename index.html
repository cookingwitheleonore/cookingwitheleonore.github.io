        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Eléonore Cedroni and I've loved cooking for as long as I can remember.
          I can honestly say that there isn't much I enjoy more in life than cooking and eating.
          I am French and like most French people I think that the love of food runs through my veins.
          I grew up eating homemade meals and cooking with my mom and grandmother.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before college I decided to attend culinary school in NYC in order to be able to cook anything my stomach desired.
          Fast forward 10 years: I graduated culinary school with a Chef's Diploma, did my cooking internship in a 2 star Michelin restaurant in Paris, went to college, graduated with Honors, worked in the food industry where I helped develop one of the most famous French pastry shops internationally as well as organizing cooking classes for children, and finally realized along the way that what I enjoyed most was cooking in my kitchen with young people who are passionate about food and getting their hands dirty.
          So if your kido loves food, loves to cook, wants to learn how to cook, you've come to the right place!
